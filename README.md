#Abstract

Mathematical modelling is essentially a way of describing how our world works, using
a precise, concise, objective language. The complexity of these models stems from the fact
that not only do individuals within a population differ, but also the external influences on
them vary. They can be used for a number of purposes, such as scientific understanding,
quantifying the impact of different changes on a system, and can also help to make tactical
and strategic decisions.
Models can be classified according to different aspects, depending on the number
of populations, they can be single or multi-population models, classical or structural.
To choose the mathematical method, it is important to determine whether the model is
continuous or discrete.
The modelling process can be divided into four different stages: construction, study,
testing and finally use. Problems can arise when moving from one stage to the next, and
it is always necessary to go back to the previous step. In the event of a subsequent change
at any stage, the testing phase must be repeated. Mathematical modelling came to the
fore in population research between 1900 and 1940, mainly in the context of predator-
prey relationships and competition theories. The models still used today are those of A.
J. Lotka, V. Volterra, G.F. Gause and A.J. Nicholson.
In my thesis, I will use three methods to estimate the unknown parameters of the
specified model, including the integral, log integral method, where I will use the Lotka-
Volterra predation model as a leading tool for three species, and finally, I will try to
improve the results by particle swarm optimization. I compare the results with solutions
from an advanced software package incorporating artificial intelligence.
